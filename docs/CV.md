University of British Columbia, Vancouver Canada.

*First Aid Level I*

## Proficiency
I have experience managing hard-rock and soft-rock geophysical datasets, handling information flow and visualization. I have performed inversions and written inversion code for gravity, DC and seismic data. I have strong mathematical ability especially linear algebra and numerical optimation. I can write code in Matlab, C, C++, Python and Javascript and have the base skills necessary to quickly pick up additional languages. I have written programs in all of these languages including desktop applications, server-side web programs and simulation and numerical solvers. I am a proficient Linux administrator and have run several servers including virtualized machines. I have spent a great amount of time outdoors and enjoy mountaineering and outdoor life. I consider this an asset for positions which involve extended periods working from camps.
