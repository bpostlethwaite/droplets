### Applicable Skills
#### Geophysics
* Theory and application of large scale reflection seismology and generation of seismic rock properties (Thesis focus)
* Management of seismic datasets: developed a programming environment for seismic database querying and data visualization in Python
* Seismic acquisition theory, different gathers, basics of land and marine acquisition
* Seismic data processing flow:  wrote Matlab code base for seismic pre-processing, receiver function calculation & analysis and post-processing with high degree of automation
